<p>Shortly after high school I joined the Air Force. I became an aerospace physiologist technician, 
  which was my number one job choice. I was stationed in San Antonio, TX my first 5 years. I received 
  my commission to become an aerospace physiologist in 2016. I was then stationed in Columbus, MS, 
  followed by Kadena, Japan, and lastly Washington D.C., where I worked at the Pentagon.
